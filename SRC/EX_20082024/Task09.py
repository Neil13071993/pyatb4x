#âœ… FizzBuzz Test:
#Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 100. # Loop For
#However, for multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and
#for multiples of 5, print "Buzz."
#For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz."

#i = range(1,100)
for i in range(1,101):
    if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:
        print("FizzBuzz", end= ' ')
    elif i % 3 == 0:
        print("Fizz", end= ' ')
    elif i % 5 == 0:
